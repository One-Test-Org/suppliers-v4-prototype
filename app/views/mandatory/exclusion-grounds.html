              appeal relating to the penalty has expired or, if later, any appeal or

              penalty or (if it was assessed) not to take proceedings to recover it.<br><br>
              (1) A Mandatory exclusion ground applies to a supplier if:<br><br>
              (a) the supplier or a connected person has entered into or carried out a

              by HMRC to have engaged in those arrangements or practices until the
              finding can no longer be challenged, whether on appeal or otherwise. <br>
