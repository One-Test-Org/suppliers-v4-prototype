              A discretionary exclusion ground applies to a supplier if:<br><br>

              A discretionary exclusion ground applies to a supplier if the supplier:<br><br>
              (a) has not performed a relevant contract to the regulated authority’s
              satisfaction,<br>
              (b) was given proper opportunity to improve performance, and

              A discretionary exclusion ground applies to a supplier if a contracting
              authority has published information under section 66(5) in respect of the
              supplier (information concerning either breach or poor performance).<br><br>
              For the purposes of this paragraph, a breach of a contract is “sufficiently
              serious” if it results in:<br>
              (a) termination (or partial termination) of the contract,<br>
              (b) the award of damages,<br>
              (c) a settlement agreement between the supplier and the regulated
              authority.<br>
              (6) In this paragraph—“regulated authority” means:<br>
              (a) a contracting authority,<br>
              (b) another public authority, or<br>
              (c) an authority outside the United Kingdom that the decisionmaker considers to be equivalent;
              “relevant contract” means a contract to which a regulated authority is party.
